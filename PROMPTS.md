This file records key prompts used to obtain assistance from a generative AI tool.

## Prompts

1. **Project spec**
   > Design, implement, test, and document a Nim game. Start with the simplest Nim game, known as 21 Nim: 2 players, predefined number of 21 objects (sticks), players alternate turns by taking 1, 2, or 3 objects, the player who removes the last object wins. Decompose the problem by using classes. Implement unit testing, apply exception handling, use proper docstring-based documentation (module/class/method docstrings).

2. **Follow-up clarifications**
   > Ensure exceptions are raised for invalid inputs (0, > max_take, > remaining). Provide a simple CLI, and tests for game logic. Use Google-style docstrings and include author/date/collaborators in module docstrings.
